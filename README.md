# COIN Nokia Digital Suggestion Box

COIN (Continuous Investment Nokia) was an app development project I independently created during my summer coop at Nokia. It was a task assigned by my manager as an effort to receive constructive feedback from 800+ employees at Nanjing TC site effectively. It was coded with wxml(html)&wxss(css)&Javascript on WeChat App Developer Tool, which is a technology involving a combination of app development and web development supported by WeChat (unfortunately can't be viewed without WeChat, but I have attached small gif demo below). 

## Key Highlights
> <strong>Compatibility: </strong> <br>
I choose WeChat Applet for its popularity in my audience (Nanjing site colleagues); they can have access to the app quickly without the need to download (Andriod and IOS compatiable, can also open on laptop). 
> Respect for user data
> Good user experience: personallized profile+secure user info, easy login, simplistic design, toasts on each action, feedback function, community area
> data visualizing
- User side
- Administrator side
> Efficient use of cloud resouce
As an effort to save backend cloud resource during code refinement phase, I successfully reduce the number of pull request to <strong><em>20%</em></strong> of original by more efficient request handling, cross-page communication, and increase structure of global data.  
> Progressive update
> Dry code

这是云开发的快速启动指引，其中演示了如何上手使用云开发的三大基础能力：

- 数据库：一个既可在小程序前端操作，也能在云函数中读写的 JSON 文档型数据库
- 文件存储：在小程序前端直接上传/下载云端文件，在云开发控制台可视化管理
- 云函数：在云端运行的代码，微信私有协议天然鉴权，开发者只需编写业务逻辑代码
